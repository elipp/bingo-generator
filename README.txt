Editing bingo templates and printing the resulting sheets requires MS Word. Don't bother with Google Docs or anything else because the conversion will break something in the sheets.

Feel free to edit anything but the table in the template sheet to your liking. Editing the table will likely result in cataclysmic errors.

Bingo text formatting (hyphenation etc.) should be done beforehand on source text level because this script isn't smart enough to do that for you.

Requires python >= 3.7

Script requires the python-docx package, install with:
pip install python-docx

Run script with defaults:
python create_bingo_sheets.py

Usage:
python create_bingo_sheets.py --help
